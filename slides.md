# Languages & retractions

Language detection is now much more accurate.

Finds many new papers in non-English languages—including languages we had no coverage of before.

---

section: Q4 Retro → Walden Launch
---

# Institutional affiliations

Fixed many missing affiliations affecting 2024-25 works.

More fixes coming soon.

# OREO

OpenAlex Rewrite Eval Overview.

Showed Walden has high fidelity to the old system—generally within a few percentage points.

Now decommissioned.

# Quarterly snapshots

Moved from monthly to quarterly.

Done.

# Bespoke GUIs

We decided not to build them.

The GUI is dead. More on that later.

# Bonus achievements

Things we shipped that weren't on the roadmap.

# Unpaywall alignment

Unpaywall is now perfectly aligned with OpenAlex.

Same system, different format.

# 2026 Strategy

layout: content
section: 2026 Strategy → AI Transformation

# Everything changes this year

I've been saying this since 2013.

> "The Web opens the workshop windows to disseminate scholarship as it happens, erasing the artificial distinction between process and product."

> "The next decade will see a dramatic dieback in journals and a Cambrian explosion of communication species."

# The three layers

- **Ecosystem** *Intelligence*
- **Bedrock** *Information*
- **Soil** *Connection*

---
layout: content
section: 2026 Strategy → Three Layers
---

# Ecosystem

Intelligence. Innovation. Vibrancy. Life.

Used to be journal monoculture—now increasingly a messy, biodiverse, energetic rainforest.

---
layout: content
section: 2026 Strategy → Three Layers
---

# Bedrock

Solidity. Dependability. Essence. Nutrient source.

Crossref, DataCite, ORCID, institutional repositories, arXiv and siblings, ROR.

---
layout: content
section: 2026 Strategy → Three Layers
---

# Soil

Homogeneity. Digestibility. Availability. Connection.

**ARIOSO:** All Research Information in One Spot, Openly.

OpenAlex. We are the soil.

# Demo: Vibe code

<div class="prompt-box">

make me an app that works on a single local html page, no dependencies. it graphs works per year of different universities. inspo: google trends. i can pick up to 8 unis. i can also narrow topic using title search. use openalex api. when i click a data point, it shows takes me to the openalex website, showing those works.

# Prompt is app

Our agency frontier extends.

No mediator needed.

Access to big, tidy, open info is the only limit.

layout: tiles
section: 2026 Strategy → What We Need
---

# What we need to be soil in 2026

- **Big** *Millions of works*
- **Tidy** *Connected, trusted*
- **Open** *CC0, API-first*
- **Sustainable** *Community-funded*

---
layout: content
section: 2026 Strategy → What We Need
---

# Big

Adding millions of new works, new funding sources.

Already the biggest in the world.

Keep pushing. Keep prioritizing community-requested sources.

---
layout: content
section: 2026 Strategy → What We Need
---

# Tidy

Connected. Deduplicated. Trusted.

Much work to do here. Two approaches:

- Improve internally (including with coding and QA agents)
- Work with community to fund and do curation

---
layout: content
section: 2026 Strategy → What We Need
---

# Open

Always open. CC0 data and code.

But also: focus on AX—Agent Experience.

Great API. Great machine-readable docs. We're an API company now.

---
layout: content
section: 2026 Strategy → What We Need
---

# Sustainable

Convince the community of our value, so they fund us.

- Enterprise: tie value to API
- Edu/Gov: tie value to community representation

---
layout: content
section: 2026 Strategy → What We Need
---

# The stakes

If we want open science, we have to pay for it.

We have to work together.

Otherwise the for-profits will do it worse, and more expensive.
